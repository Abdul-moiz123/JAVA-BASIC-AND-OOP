        //**) POINTS :-

        //1) EVERY LINE OF CODE MUST BE INSIDE THE CLASS
        //2) FILE NAME MUST BE SAME AS PUBLIC CLASS NAME

        //4) JAVA IS CASE SENSITIVE (MYCLASS ANS myClass are different)
        //5) java is type-language (we have to define type of every variable)
        //6) java has multple class and class has main method that will executed the code in class

//     HOW TO DISPLAY OUTPUT ON THE SCREEN:-

        System.out.println("you can print anything inside it"); // STRING HAS TO BE IN " ".
        System.out.println(23); // int can be written simply
        System.out.println(2+3);  // you can perform operation (+,-,*,/,%) inside the statement

        // System --> built-in-class
        // out--> menber --> System class
        // println --> method --> out

    }
